## Project overview

Carbon emissions, specifically CO2 emissions, have become a central issue in the global conversation about climate change and environmental responsibility. In recent years, the urgency to address rising carbon footprints has gained tremendous momentum in the media, among governments, and within the business world. CO2 emissions are one of the primary contributors to global warming, and understanding their sources is critical for implementing effective climate action strategies.

A country's carbon footprint can be directly or indirectly influenced by a variety of economic, social, and environmental factors, including energy consumption, industrial activities, population growth, and urbanization. Accurately predicting these emissions is essential for governments and organizations seeking to implement policies that reduce their environmental impact. By focusing on understanding the key drivers of CO2 emissions, we can better forecast future trends and identify areas where interventions may be most effective.

## objectives

In this project, we aim to predict a country's CO2 emissions per capita based on several key economic and demographic factors, such as GDP, energy consumption, and population dynamics. While total CO2 emissions are an important metric for understanding a countryâ€™s overall environmental impact, focusing on CO2 emissions per capita provides a more nuanced perspective.

CO2 per capita measures the average amount of carbon dioxide emitted per person in a country, offering insight into how carbon-intensive the lifestyle or development model is for individuals within that country. This metric is especially useful for comparing countries of varying population sizes, allowing for more equitable comparisons of carbon footprints between smaller and larger nations.

## Scope of the project
The project does not account for all possible variables that could influence emissions, such as industrial practices, geopolitical factors, or technological innovation. We are also not considering the temporal effects or the inclusion of potential external events (e.g., pandemics, wars) that may affect emissions data.
